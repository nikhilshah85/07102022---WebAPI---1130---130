1. create a new database with table and sample data
	https://ctxt.io/2/AAAQIjLuEg
2. create a new web api project

3. Project does not have modules to with EF and sql server database

	add below Nuget packages from solution explorer

	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

	EF Core is based on ORM Pattern - Object relational mapping
		which will have a class - mapped to table in database
		properties mapped to columns in database table
		file mapped to database (DbContext File)

4. Create POCO classes or ORM classes with the help of powershell command

	Tools -> Nuget package manager -> Nuget package manager console
Scaffold-DbContext "server=WIN8\NIKHILINSTANCE; database=productsWebAPIDB;integrated security=true" -OutputDir Models\EF -Provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

5. Build the application, right click on controller folder and add new API controller
	with action using EF

6. in the controller - it uses DI - dependency injection by default, half configuration done and half we need to do, we are removeing the first half as of now 

	Thus, instantiate new object of dbcontext class and comment/remve constructor
